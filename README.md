# üìö Calculus Notes for AI/ML üìàüß†
Welcome to this repository where I've uploaded comprehensive and high-quality notes on key calculus topics that form the mathematical backbone of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
These notes are meant for:
  >Students diving into AI/ML and needing a strong foundation in calculus
  >Anyone who wants concise, well-organized material on calculus topics
  >Quick reference during AI/ML projects, research, or practice.

# üìÑ Topics Covered
These topics are essential for understanding and implementing many machine learning algorithms and optimization techniques:
>Limits, Continuity, and Differentiability
>Methods of Differentiation
>Application of Derivatives
>Maxima and Minima
>Indefinite Integration
>Definite Integration
>Differential Equations

Each file contains clear explanations, formulas, and illustrative examples, compressed for easier sharing and faster loading.

# üí° Why These Notes?
You don‚Äôt need to master everything, but leave no gap in understanding the calculus behind AI and ML.
These notes are:
  >Easy to download and study
  >Useful as a go-to reference
  >Great for exam prep, interviews, or building ML models

# üì• How to Use
>Download the PDFs directly from this repo.
>Use them to revise or strengthen your calculus skills whenever needed.
>Apply concepts directly in ML/AI projects (e.g., gradient descent, loss function optimization, etc.)

# üîó Download All Notes
